  <p><strong>Vegetarian eggplant and zucchini lasagna</p></strong>  
  <p>Lasagna for me is one of the tastiest dishes out there. But it has to be well made with quality dough and fillings and if possible very golden like the one in the photo.</p><p> Today's recipe was my first vegetarian lasagna and I really liked it, so good that I can dispense with the meat, which for me is not so simple.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>250 g dry cooked lasagna noodles (or fresh uncooked pasta)</li>
    <li>1 large chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 chopped yellow or red bell pepper</li>
    <li>4 minced garlic cloves</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large zucchini, cubed</li>
    <li>1 large eggplant, diced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of oegano</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 liter of well-seasoned tomato sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
    <li>300 g sliced ​​or grated mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>100 g grated parmesan cheese</li>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><p><em>How to make</p></em>
    <p>Place the zucchini and eggplant cubes in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Let rest for 30 minutes. It will release liquid, discard the liquid.</p>
    <p>Sauté the onion with the garlic and bell pepper in the oil until they are soft and golden to taste. Add the zucchini, eggplant and herbs, stir, cover the pan and cook without liquid until the vegetables are soft. Taste for salt and salt to taste.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><em>Assembly of lasagna</p></em>
    <p>Spread a ladle of sauce on the baking sheet. On top make a layer of pasta, on top of the pasta make a layer of vegetables, cover the vegetables with more sauce. Make another layer of pasta and cover with sauce and mozzarella cheese, sprinkle with a little Parmesan. Repeat the layer of pasta, vegetables and sauce. Make as many layers as you can, the number of layers will depend on the size and height of your baking dish.</p>
    <p>I like to finish with mozzarella cheese and sprinkle a lot of grated Parmesan cheese on top.</p>
    <p>Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until bubbly and cheese is gratinated.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><em>Tips / Substitutions</em></p>
    <p>I don't adapt well to pre-cooked pasta, I prefer the fresh one or the common one that I cook in salted water and then assemble the lasagna. Fresh pasta doesn't need to be cooked beforehand, just assemble!</p>
    <p>If you want to use pre-cooked pasta you may need to use a larger amount of sauce, read the package of the pasta you purchased for the recommended amount of sauce.</p>
    <p>Use whatever vegetables you like in your lasagna: carrots, peas, corn, etc.</p>
    <p>Looking for a lighter dish? Swap the mozzarella for another less greasy cheese or light mozzarella.</p>
