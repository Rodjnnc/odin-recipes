  <p><strong>Broccoli and arugula pizza</p></strong>  
  <p>Why not use cooler-weather vegetables like broccoli and arugula as an unconventional pizza topping? The arugula adds a slightly bitter, peppery taste--for a milder flavor, use spinach instead. Serve with wedges of fresh tomato tossed with vinegar, olive oil, basil and freshly ground pepper.</p>

  <p><sem>Ingredients</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough, preferably whole-wheat</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped broccoli florets</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>5 ounces arugula ,any tough stems removed, chopped (about 6 cups)</li>
    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup prepared pesto</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
  
  <p><em>Directions</em></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Position oven rack in the lowest position; preheat to 450 degrees F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>        
    <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about the size of the baking sheet. Transfer to the baking sheet. Bake until puffed and lightly crisped on the bottom, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook broccoli and water in a large skillet over medium heat, covered, until the broccoli is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in arugula and cook, stirring, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Spread pesto evenly over the crust, top with the broccoli mixture and sprinkle with cheese. Bake until crispy and golden and the cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
